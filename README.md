# Gender stereotype recognition with Prolog

## Abstract

Stereotypes are generalized belief about a particular category of people and are used as expectation that people might have about every person of a particular group. They are often overgeneralized, inaccurate, and resistant to new information and they can be positive, neutral, or negative. The main idea of this project is to analyze and extract classic explicit stereotypes from everyday language through logic programming.
